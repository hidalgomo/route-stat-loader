## Building Application

### Installing packages

from a terminal change directory (`cd`) to the root folder for the project. Usually where the package.json file is located. Issue the following command:

`npm install` This installs all necessary packages needed to build the application. This is the first command needed for the following two.

`npm run build` This creates a release-ready build under the dist directory in the project root folder. This is the files you would want to copy over into you server directory where application is hosted.

`npm start` This allows you to run the application in development mode, locally.
